# fract-ol
This project is to create a small fractal exploration program.

This program offer 3 different types of fractals: the Julia set, the Mandelbrot set and the Burning ship.

You can to vary the mouse (without clicking) the parameter of the Julia set and change colors of fractals. Also the mouse wheel zooms in and out on the current mouse position, and this in a quasi infinite way (modulo the limits of the machine). Try it :-)
